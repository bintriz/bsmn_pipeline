bsmn-pipeline implements various cluster jobs, arranged for genome alignment, variant calling and variant filtering.

Getting the bsmn pipeline
=========================

    git clone https://github.com/bsmn/bsmn-pipeline.git

Creating an environment from YAML file
======================================

To create a new conda environment from the given environment.yml file, run:

    conda env create -f /path/to/environment.yml 

By default, the name of environment will be 'bp'. you can change it by adding a'-n <name>' option to the command above.

Installing ucsc packages
========================

ucsc-* packages were excluded from the environment file because of conflicting with root.
Here you need to install those packages by running commands as follows:

    conda install -n bp ucsc-fetchchromsizes ucsc-bigwigaverageoverbed ucsc-wigtobigwig ucsc-liftover

Building CNVnator
=================

To build and install CNVnator, activate the 'bp' environment and type the following commands:

    conda activate bp # Make sure you've activated the environment you created.
    cd $CONDA_PREFIX # Within the environment directory
    git clone https://github.com/yjjang/CNVnator.git
    cd CNVnator
    wget https://github.com/samtools/samtools/releases/download/1.10/samtools-1.10.tar.bz2
    tar xjf samtools-1.10.tar.bz2 && mv samtools-1.10 samtools
    cd samtools
    ./configure && make -j 8
    cd ..
    make YEPPPLIBDIR=../lib YEPPPINCLUDEDIR=../include/yeppp
    cd $CONDA_PREFIX/bin && ln -s ../CNVnator/cnvnator
