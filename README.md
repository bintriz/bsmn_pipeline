# bsmn_pipeline
BSMN common data processing pipeline

# Setup and installation
This pipeline can be run in any cluster system using SGE job scheduler. I would recommend set your own cluster in AWS using AWS ParallelCluster.

## AWS ParallelCluster
For installoing and setting up parallelcluster, please see the [`Getting Started Guide`](https://aws-parallelcluster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) for AWS ParallelCluster.

## Installing pipeline
Clone bsmn_pipeline where you want it installed in your cluster.  For example, if you work with an m5.large type AWS EC2 instance we recommend the file systems mounted at `/shared` or `/efs`.
```
$ cd /shared
$ git clone https://github.com/bsmn/bsmn_pipeline
```

Install software dependencies into `bsmn_pipeline/tools` running the following script.
```
$ cd bsmn_pipeline
$ ./install_tools.sh
```

Download required resource files including the reference sequence. This step require a synapse account that can access to the Synapse page syn17062535.
```
$ ./download_resources.sh
```

## Extra set up for SGE
The pipeline require a parallel environment named "threaded" in  your SGE system. If your SGE system doen't have this parallel environment, you should add it into yours.
```
$ sudo su
# qconf -Ap << END
pe_name            threaded
slots              99999
user_lists         NONE
xuser_lists        NONE
start_proc_args    NONE
stop_proc_args     NONE
allocation_rule    $pe_slots
control_slaves     FALSE
job_is_first_task  TRUE
urgency_slots      min
accounting_summary TRUE
qsort_args         NONE
END
```
```
# qconf -mattr queue pe_list threaded all.q
```

# Usage
## genome_mapping
Run the pipeline using a wrapper shell script.
```bash
genome_mapping.sh sample_list.txt
```

### sample_list.txt format
The lines starting with # will be commented out and ignored. The header line should start with # as well. Eg.
```
#sample_id	file_name	location
5154_brain-BSMN_REF_brain-534-U01MH106876	bulk_sorted.bam	syn10639574
5154_fibroblast-BSMN_REF_fibroblasts-534-U01MH106876	fibroblasts_sorted.bam	syn10639575
5154_NeuN_positive-BSMN_REF_NeuN+_E12-677-U01MH106876	E12_MDA_common_sorted.bam	s3://nda-bsmn/abyzova_1497485007384/data/E12_MDA_common_sorted.bam
5154_NeuN_positive-BSMN_REF_NeuN+_C12-677-U01MH106876	C12_MDA_common_sorted.bam	/efs/data/C12_MDA_common_sorted.bam
```
The "location" column can be a Synape ID, S3Uri of the NDA or a user, or LocalPath. For Data download, synapse or aws clients, or symbolic lins will be used, respectively.

### options
```
--parentid syn123
```
With parentid option, you can specify a Synapse ID of project or folder where to upload result bam files. If it is set, the result bam files will be uploaded into Synapse and deleted. Otherwise, they will be locally kept.
